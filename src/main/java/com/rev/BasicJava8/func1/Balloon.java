	 DEFINITIONS:
	 Pass by Value: The method parameter values are copied to 
                    another variable and then the copied object is 
                    passed, that's why it's called pass by value.

     Pass by Reference: An alias or reference (pointer) to the actual 
                    parameter is passed to the method, that's 
                    why it's called pass by reference
        
    Java is pass by value ONLY                
	C++ and Pascal can be either pass by reference or pass by value
