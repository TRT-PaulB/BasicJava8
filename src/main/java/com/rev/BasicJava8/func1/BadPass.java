		// POINT TO REMEMBER:
		// - when values are passed to a method, whether primitive or object reference, they are copies.
		// - just changing the value of the copy. When the thread of the called method's stack layer
		//     is terminated, the local references to the objects that may have been swapped are destroyed,
		//     so the caller reference will still point to the objects as they did before the call
		// - you can manipulate the value that a reference points to as long as you do not assign it to another reference,
		//   because you are still pointing to the same underlying object which you are updating.
		// - passing the top level reference to a method is enough, there is no need to be concerned with the
		//   references that might be encapsulated within a complex object
